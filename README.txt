Roboloom Project 4/27/2025, made for CMU class 15367

How to use:
Input all the notes into the music_notes.txt file. The first line should specify treble or bass. All subsequent rows should have a note pitch followed by duration. The pitch can also be replaced by a rest. Run the musicgen.py file within the directory and it should generate an image of the music as well as the instructions for roboloom.
